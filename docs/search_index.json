Love, Max Schubach, and David Gokhman 2026-02-04 Overview This pipeline is designed to help investigators evaluate the quality of their MPRA, quickly identify pitfalls, trace them to their source, and mitigate them. The scripts provided help ensure that the resulting MPRA data are suitable for robust statistical analysis and meaningful biological interpretation. This Bookdown accompanies our guide for best practices for MPRAs, which outlines recommendations for study design and interpretation [REF TBD]. The manuscript covers all key experimental and analytical steps, including library design, and estimation of activity differential activity. It then describes core problems that often compromise MPRA quality, illustrating how these issues manifest in the data, and offering practical strategies for correction and optimization. Because each issue can influence multiple quality metrics, and each metric may be affected by several issues, the relationships form a many-to-many network. The figures presented below map these interdependencies and connect them to recommended diagnostic analyses. Abbreviations CRE – cis-regulatory element cCRE – candidate CRE BC - barcode logFC – log2(fold-change) between alleles Usage The quality control (QC) pipeline is organized into two chapters: QC of the association step between candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) and barcodes (BCs) QC of the RNA and DNA quantification step Root problems, impacted quality metrics and recommended diagnostic analyses for the sequence-barcode association step. Diagnostic analyses are presented alongside their corresponding manuscript figure and/or Bookdown (BD) reference number Root problems, impacted quality metrics and recommended analyses for the RNA and DNA quantification step. For each analysis, we provide an example of a successful and an unsuccessful dataset to illustrate how they manifest in the analysis. We welcome questions, feedback, or suggestions. Please feel free to reach out at david.gokhman [at] weizmann.ac.il. Scripts All of these analyses are integrated into the quality control pipeline described in this resource, with scripts provided here: GokhmanLabOrganization/MPRA_QC_analysis.

Each chapter is accompanied by a dedicated script that allows the user to run all analyses presented in this book. Below, we describe the files required to run the pipeline. Alongside each analysis, you will find the input files needed in order to run it. Example files are provided below. 1.1 Associations 1.1.1 Script Association_analysis.ipynb 1.1.2 Input As part of MPRA data processing, the pipeline produces a set of intermediate output files.

Data is downsampled in order to assess whether we have reached saturation in the percentage of active cCREs. Then, data is extrapolated to predict whether additional sequencing would help improve the results. Interpretation: The successful example showcases sufficient sequencing depth: the percentage of active cCREs has reached a plateau, and more sequencing is not expected to affect it. The unsuccessful example showcases suboptimal RNA sequencing depth: additional sequencing will likely affect the percentage of active cCREs. 3.11 Cumulative RNA reads Goal: Assess jackpotting Input file: comb_df Evaluated metrics: RNA Complexity, Dynamic range Legend: A cumulative distribution showcasing the fraction of RNA reads from each cCRE. cCREs are sorted by their RNA read counts.

The unsuccessful example showcases little to no correlation. 3.18 Cross-validaiton: cell types Goal: Assess reproducibility between different cell types Input file: cell_types_df Evaluated metrics: Reproducibility Legend: Log2(RNA/DNA) values of shared control sequences across two cell types. Each data point is a hexagon representing the local density of cCREs. Interpretation: Although cell types differ in their trans environments, many regulatory networks are shared, particularly between closely related cell types. As a result, regulatory sequences often exhibit similar activity across cell types. This pattern is evident in the successful example, which shows a strong correlation between cell types. The unsuccessful example, on the other hand, showcases no correlation. 3.19 Minimizing noise Goal: Remove outlier barcodes and optimize minimum DNA count threshold to improve reproducibility Input file: different_std_threshold_analysis Evaluated metrics: Reproducibility Legend: Each panel shows the correlation between replicates across different threshold of outlier removal (horizontal), and minimum DNA counts per cCRE (vertical).
